# Canonical Libraries

Each file here is a “use-case library” module: a distilled, repeatable recipe that produces graphs + evidence.

Conventions:
- Use explicit file paths and commands.
- Prefer `engine/reports/` for living docs and `tmp/` for scratch outputs.
- Reference the Meta3 hypergraph schema (nodes + hyperedges + metadata).
