# Library: Receipts + UTIR Evidence Loop

## Purpose
Keep work auditable: every claim should be backed by a receipt, a graph packet, or a report artifact.

## Principles
- Generate to `engine/reports/` for living docs.
- Use receipts for any state mutation (writes/execs).
- Prefer deterministic runs when reproducibility matters.

## Evidence
- `meta3-graph-core/README.md`
- `meta3-graph-core/SYSTEM_REPORT.md`
