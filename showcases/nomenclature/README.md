# Showcase: Nomenclature & Concepts

This showcase demonstrates end-to-end “intellectual compression”:
engine data → distilled concepts → hypergraph → explorable viewer.

Artifacts:
- `glossary.md` — English glossary
- `concepts.json` — machine-readable concept set (with sources + curation)
- `hypergraph.json` — distilled concept hypergraph
- `index.html` — self-contained viewer for `hypergraph.json`
