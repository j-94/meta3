# Showcase: Mission → Code Bridge (Measured)

This showcase demonstrates a **measured** bridge between a mission graph and a code-oriented hypergraph.

## What you get
- A merged hypergraph with `mission_ref` bridges
- An evaluation report with precision/recall metrics
- A self-contained HTML viewer of the merged hypergraph

## Artifacts
- `hypergraph.json` — input hypergraph (code-oriented)
- `mission_graph.json` — input mission graph (mission-oriented)
- `merged.hypergraph.json` — merged hypergraph (includes bridge edges)
- `eval.json` — precision/recall metrics for `mission_ref` bridges
- `index.html` — rendered viewer of `merged.hypergraph.json`

## Why it’s impressive
Most “agentic systems” can narrate intent ↔ code, but they can’t **score** whether the bridges are correct.
This demo makes the bridge measurable.
