# Showcase: Capability Graph + English Report

This showcase demonstrates that “capability” is not vibes:
catalog → graph → English → explorable viewer.

Artifacts:
- `hypergraph.json` — capability hypergraph derived from the catalog (handles duplicate IDs)
- `capability_report.md` — English explanation of capabilities/modules/triggers
- `index.html` — self-contained viewer for `hypergraph.json`
