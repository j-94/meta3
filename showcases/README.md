# Showcases

These are “muscle flex” demos: they produce **real artifacts** (English + graphs + viewers), not just claims.

## 1) Nomenclature → Concepts → Hypergraph → Viewer

- Purpose: derive project nomenclature from engine data, then render a navigable concept graph.
- Artifacts:
  - `showcases/nomenclature/glossary.md`
  - `showcases/nomenclature/concepts.json`
  - `showcases/nomenclature/hypergraph.json`
  - `showcases/nomenclature/index.html` (self-contained viewer)

## 2) Capability Catalog → Capability Graph + English Report

- Purpose: show what the system can do and where it lives, in both graph form and plain English.
- Artifacts:
  - `showcases/capability-graph/hypergraph.json`
  - `showcases/capability-graph/index.html` (self-contained viewer)
  - `showcases/capability-graph/capability_report.md`
