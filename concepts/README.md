# Concepts

This folder is the output of the **nomenclature extraction** pipeline:
- `concepts.json` — machine-readable concepts (IDs, terms, definitions, sources)
- `glossary.md` — human-readable glossary derived from `concepts.json`

These are generated from the engine repo data (capability catalogs + system docs).
