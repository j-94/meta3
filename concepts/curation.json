  "definitions": {
    "State Hypergraph": "The state model of the system: nodes represent entities (files, concepts, artifacts, tasks) and hyperedges represent causal relationships that can connect multiple entities at once.",
    "Graph Transducer Runtime": "A runtime that consumes events, evaluates state transitions as graph deltas, validates them against invariants, and applies them while emitting durable evidence (receipts).",
    "Receipts Beat Recollection": "Operational rule: don’t rely on memory. Every claim and state change should be backed by an artifact (receipt, graph packet, report).",
    "UTIR": "Universal Tool Invocation Receipt: a structured evidence stream used to audit and reproduce actions (writes/execs) performed by the system.",
    "LeJIT": "Just-in-time verification layer that validates proposed actions/deltas against invariants before they are executed.",
    "JIT Verification": "Just-in-time verification: validate proposed actions/deltas against invariants before execution, producing accept/reject decisions with evidence.",
    "Capability Catalog": "A machine-readable list of what the system can do (capabilities), including triggers, types, and source modules.",
    "Capability Graph": "A hypergraph derived from the capability catalog that links capabilities to triggers, types, and source modules (not a filesystem 'contains' graph).",
    "Capability Report (English)": "A human-readable report explaining what each capability/module does, how to invoke it, and where it is implemented.",
    "ToolHub": "The capability scanner/catalog generator (ToolHub) used to enumerate available capabilities and tools.",
    "Meta3 Graph Core": "Deterministic Rust kernel that reads ops packets / graph deltas and reifies them into reality with auditable receipts."
